Acorn Emulator Next Steps:

* Implement data transfer instructions.
* Verify the ARMv2 core.
    * Should RRX update the carry flag when used with a non-S-suffix instruction?
    + No, it just sets the carry-out from the barrel shifter, the instruction defines
      what should be done with that.
* Implement long multiply - Emulation needs testing
* Implement move to/from PSR - Emulation needs testing
* Implement half-word data transfer - Emulation needs testing
* Implement signed data transfer - Emulation needs testing
* Implement generic co-processor interface? - Emulation needs testing
* Implement FPA co-processor
* Implement Thumb for ARMv4 - possibly not worth it.
    
* Convert classes to templates using the base class as a template parameter in order to fit different components together.
* Implement MEMC address translation + Memory mapped I/O.
* Beef up the disassembler to produce tokens rather than a single line of text.
* Create a desktop disassembler tool which allows code to be annotated and edited and for those changes to be saved as a side file or a new block of assembly language source code.
    * Qt or Win32-only? Not sure.
* Disassemble the RISC OS 3.10 ROM to discover POST and other bits.
* Implement IOC emulation
    * Implement I2C bus and CMOS RAM
* Implement VIDC emulation with memory frame buffer.
* Implement IOEB (Input/Output Expansion Block)
    * Controls 82c710/711 and extra ROM access (another 4MB).
    * Controls a faster video clock for hi-res display modes
* Implement 82c710/711 I/O controller emulation
